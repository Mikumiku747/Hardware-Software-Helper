Hardware-Software-Helper
========================

A desktop application for helpful information on hardware and software, made with livecode. Done as part of a school assessment task. To view the nice shiny website, go to Mikumiku747.github.io/Hardware-Software-Helper.

Application downloads
---------------------

Looking for just the application? It's not done yet, but when it is, there should be a link to the latest version of the built application.

All the other docs
------------------

You can download the whole project as a zip or just grab parts of it here. Alternatively, a better solution is to clone it into the desktop version of GitHub (if you have it.) so you have the latest copy all the time.
