Support

Installation
------------
To use the application, all you have to do is download the application (See above) and run it by double clicking. The application is portable, so you can run it off of a USB or on a network drive. If you wantto make a desktop shortcut, right click it and press "Create shortcut" and move the resulting file to the desktop, start menu, or anywhere else you need a shortcut. 

Usage
-----
Using the app is easy. When you start the app, you can either choose "Elements of a computer system" or "Hardware in SSD" to go to that category, and from there you can choose a topic. You can also jump to any page with the "Go to..." menu at the bottom.

When on a page, you can press next and previous to move forwards and backwards through all the pages of the app. This allows you to read the info like a book. You can also jump to any page at any time using the "Go to..." menu. And if you want to start again, you can press the home Icon to go back the start menu of the application.

The summary pages at the start of each topic provide an overview on all the topics in an area, and you can choose a topic from these pages as well. 

Removal
-------
If you don't want the app any more, simply delete it and it's gone. If you made shortcuts, you'll need to delete them yourself, so keep track of the ones you make.
